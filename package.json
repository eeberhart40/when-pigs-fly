  "description": "### Background and Overview `When Pigs Fly` is a fanciful barnyard take on the classic helicopter game. The game will center on a winged pig.  The user will use the spacebar to navigate the pig up and down on a 2-D board. Obstacles like pitchforks, fence-posts and birds will come into view as the board scrolls. If the pig collides with an obstacle the game ends. Points accrue as time elapses. Local storage will save the top 10 scores. There will be a farm/barnyard theme. Hoedown music will play in the background and a `toggle music` button will allow users to turn the music on or off.",
